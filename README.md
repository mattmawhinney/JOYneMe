WythMe.co is a full-stack web app built on Rails and styled with Bootstrap. It is a social network for
spontaneous social events like getting a cup of coffee or going for a walk aimed at people who want to get out of 
the office in the middle of the day. 

It was built as my capstone project for Wyncode(wyncode.co), a 9-week web development bootcamp based out of the Lab Miami.
